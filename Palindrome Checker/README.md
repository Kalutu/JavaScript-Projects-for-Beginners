# Palindrome Checker
A simple JavaScript function that checks if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

## Function Description
The `palindrome` function takes a string as an input and returns `true` if the string is a palindrome, and `false` otherwise. 

A string is considered a palindrome if it remains the same when its characters are reversed.
